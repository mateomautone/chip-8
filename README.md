# CHIP-8
CHIP-8 Interpreter

## Goals
My goals for this project are to be able to implement a working chip-8 emulator/interpreter using only: the Technical Reference, and 'The C Programming Language' book.
I aim  to get used to working with the C language, as well as gaining some basic experience on building emulators/interpreters, my goal is to be able to make a NES Emulator (or similar console) in the future.
